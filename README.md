# Aeroelastic-Wing-Design

This project analyzes and designs a cantilever wing using static aeroelastic principles. The goal is to ensure compliance with key constraints such as lift capacity, divergence speed, wing deflection, and aileron effectiveness.

## Project Overview
- Target lift: 700 N at 70 m/s
- Max wing-tip deflection: < 1°
- Wing-root bending moment: < 300 N-m
- Divergence speed: > 150 m/s
